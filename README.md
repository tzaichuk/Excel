# Excel homework

Unit 1 | Assignment - KickStart My Chart

## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects aunched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Instructions


* Using the Excel table provided, you will be modifying and analyzing the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some of the market trends.
